# POV-Ray Thread - Bitmap to 3D canvas and cross stitch simulation converter

Python program for conversion of bitmap image (in PNG or PPM format) to some sort of solid objects in [POVRay](https://www.povray.org/ "Persistence of Vision Raytracer") 3D format, resembling threads of canvas or cross stitches. Each source image pixel is converted to a 3D object, colored after source pixel.

## Main program GUI

Main program [**POVRayThread.py**](https://github.com/Dnyarri/POVthread/blob/main/POVRayThread.py) provides general linking between PNG and PPM/PGM reading modules and POV-Ray writing one.

Useful GUI features include mouse event handling:

- After starting program *double click* on preview area is equal to "Open...", right click to "File..." menu;
- After opening an image *Ctrl + Left click* is *"zoom in"*, *Alt + Left click* is *"zoom out"*, similar to Photoshop;
- After filtering an image (pressing "Enter") left click is source\result preview switch.

## Brief effects module description  

- **Linen.py** - creates an object, simulating canvas, colored after source image (taffeta, print on canvas, and the like).
- **Stitch.py** - simulates common cross stitching embroidery appearance.

## Prerequisite and Dependencies

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.11 or above.
2. [PyPNG](https://gitlab.com/drj11/pypng "Pure Python PNG I/O module"). Copy included into current POV-Ray Thread distribution.
3. [PyPNM](https://pypi.org/project/PyPNM/ "Pure Python PNM I/O module"). Copy included into current POV-Ray Thread distribution.
4. Tkinter. Normally included into standard CPython distribution.

> [!NOTE]
> Since POVRayThread 1.21.7.11 and Averager 3.21.7.11 PyPNM version included into distribution updated to [PyPNM "Victory 2" main](https://github.com/Dnyarri/PyPNM "Pure Python PPM and PGM I/O module"), intended to be used with Python 3.11 and above. The only actual limitation is that main version does not have a workaround for displaying 16 bpc images necessary for old Tkinter included into old CPython distributions. If you want bringing old Tkinter compatibility back, download [PyPNM extended compatibility version](https://github.com/Dnyarri/PyPNM/tree/py34 "Pure Python PPM and PGM I/O module for Python 3.4") and plug it in manually.

## Installation and Usage

Programs distribution is rather self-contained and is supposed to run right out of the box. Program is equipped with minimal GUI, so all you have to do after starting a program is use "Open..." dialog to open image file, then use "Export..." to name 3D file to be created, then wait while program does the job, then open resulting file with POV-Ray and render the scene.

## Averager

[**Averager.py**](https://github.com/Dnyarri/POVthread/blob/main/Averager.py) was initially created as an accessory for preprocessing source PNG files. It averages image colors (L, LA, RGB, RGBA) within linear or squarish areas between contrast edges, providing color reduction somewhat similar to used in real cross stitch where single thread is used to produce several stitches in a row.

Later this filtering module was added to *POVRayThread*, making *Averager* redundant; however, it is still included into distribution as an illustration of 100% pure Python image filtering program, working at quite acceptable speed without any large third-party C packages.
