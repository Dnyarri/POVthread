"""Averaging image pixels in a row until reaching
``abs(average - current) > threshold``, then repeating in a column.

Pure Python image filtering module for `POV-Ray Thread`_ and
`Averager`_ applications.

Initial purpose was transforming row sequences of closely colored pixels
into a sequence of the same solid color to simulate single thread in canvas;
however filter may work with columns as well,
producing squarish flat color areas.

Usage
-----

::

    from filter.avgrow import filter
    filtered_image = filter(source_image, threshold_x, threshold_y, wraparound, keep_alpha)

where:

- **``source_image``**: input image as list of lists of lists
  of ``int`` channel values;
- **``threshold_x``**: threshold upon which row averaging stops
  and restarts from this pixel on (``int``);
- **``threshold_y``**: threshold upon which column averaging stops
  and restarts from this pixel on (``int``);
- **``wrap_around``**: whether image edge pixel will be read in
  "repeat edge" or "wrap around" mode (``bool``);
- **``keep_alpha``**: whether returned filtered image will have
  alpha channel copied from source image, or alpha channel will be
  filtered along with color (``bool``).

.. note:: Both threshold values (``int``) are used literally,
    regardless of 8 bpc or 16 bpc color depth.
    Filter input does not include color depth and/or range value in any form,
    therefore threshold range normalization, if deemed necessary,
    must be performed at host end.

.. warning:: Some programs completely destroy L or RGB data upon saving
    LA or RGBA image pixels with A=0 (fully transparent). This may lead to
    unexpected and unpredictable results of filtering. This potential problem
    is completely out of responsibility of current filter developer.

#   History:
#   --------
# 0.10.12.3     Initial version - 12 Oct 2024. RGB only.
# 0.10.13.2     Forces RGB, skips alpha. Changed threshold condition to r, g, b
#                   separately. Seem to be just what I need.
# 0.10.25.1     Bugfix for tiny details.
# 1.16.5.10     Modularization, some optimization. Force keep alpha.
# 1.17.10.1     Edge condition bugfix.
# 2.19.14.16    Wrap around processing introduced.
# 3.20.1.1      Substantial rewriting with `map` to correctly support L.
#                   No force RGB anymore.
# 3.20.7.14     Alpha filtering. Full support for L, LA, RGB, RGBA filtering
#                   with a single `map`.
# 3.20.20.3     Code harmonization. Lambdas completely replaced with operators
#                   and defined functions to improve speed.
# 3.22.13.11    Unnecessary map to list conversions removed,
#                   necessary ones replaced with [*map] unpacking.
# 3.22.18.8     Evasive bug discovered and presumably exterminated.
# 3.26.6.18     Major minor refurbishment: docstring etc. etc.
# 3.26.20.8     Surprisingly, there is a room for optimizing "create_image"!
